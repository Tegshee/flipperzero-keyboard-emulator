# Flipper App Automation

This Python script automates the process of adding new tokens to the Flipper App. It uses the `keyboard` library to emulate keyboard presses and navigate through the app.

## Installation 

Clone the repository and install the required libraries:

```bash 
git clone <repository_url>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
Before running the script, make sure the Flipper App is open and in focus. The script will start 3 seconds after it's run to give you time to switch to the app.

```bash
python app.py
```

How it works
The script reads a list of tokens from a file and adds each one to the Flipper App. It navigates through the app by emulating keyboard presses. The layout of the keyboard is defined in the keyboard_layout variable.

Each token is added by first navigating to the add new token screen, then typing the name and secret of the token, and finally confirming the addition.
